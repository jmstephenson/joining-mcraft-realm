## 4 - Mods Glorious Mods:
The following is a curated selection of mods which provide various performance and quality of life improvements.

They aren't _essential_ but some of them are dependent upon others so pick and mix at your own risk...ðŸ˜‰

Some of the mods below will have two version options - `forge` and `fabric`.  We need to download the `fabric` version when an option is available <sup>[`1`]</sup>

### Adding them to the game
The default minecraft installation directory is

``` 
%APPDATA%\Roaming\.minecraft 
```

Typically the AppData folder is hidden, but you can open it directly by copying and pasting the above in a File Explorer window.

Create a new folder: `mods`

Copy all of the downloaded mods and paste them into this folder.

---

## Play the game

That's it.  After running the Fabric Installer a new profile will have been created in Minecraft using the resultant modded version.  All the mods will be visible under a new `Mods` menu in-game and many of them have settings that can be tweaked according to preference or to improve visuals / performance (though not usually both at the same time!).
